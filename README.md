**About**
This project was developed as part of an individual study assignment for the WebAdvanced course at Saxion University of Applied Sciences.
**ArtBidder â€“ painting auction web application**
A web application where users can explore and bid on paintings, with detailed information about artists and their works.The platform enables users to register and log in, with authentication handled securely using JWT. Visitors can search and filter paintings, view artist profiles, and explore related artworks, while authenticated users can place bids in auctions and view their winning bids.
**To run the application locally:**
- install dependencies in both the client and server folders using `npm install`.
- Then, in separate terminals, run `npm run start` inside each folder.
- Once both server and client are running, open the link provided in the client terminal (typically http://localhost:) to access the app.

Credentials for the admin and regular user are stored in `documentation/users.md`.
